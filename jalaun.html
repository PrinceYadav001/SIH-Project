    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Jalaun is one of the districts in the drought-prone Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh. The region is primarily agrarian and faces acute water shortages, especially during the summer months. Agriculture in Jalaun is highly dependent on rainfall, and the area faces extreme water stress due to erratic monsoons and groundwater depletion. This case study explores the challenges related to water management in rural Jalaun and the strategies employed to address these challenges.</p>

    <section id="challenges">
        <h2>Challenges in Water Management</h2>
        <p>Rural Jalaun faces several water management challenges, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Erratic Rainfall:</strong> The Bundelkhand region, including Jalaun, experiences highly irregular and unpredictable rainfall. Extended periods of drought and short, intense monsoons lead to water scarcity and soil degradation.</li>
            <li><strong>Groundwater Depletion:</strong> Overexploitation of groundwater for irrigation has led to a significant decline in groundwater levels. Many villages in Jalaun rely solely on groundwater, which is rapidly depleting due to insufficient rainfall recharge.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil Erosion and Degradation:</strong> Due to deforestation and lack of proper soil conservation methods, the soil has become less capable of retaining moisture, further exacerbating water scarcity.</li>
            <li><strong>Poor Irrigation Practices:</strong> Traditional methods of irrigation such as flood irrigation lead to excessive water wastage, further depleting the already limited water resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Inadequate Water Storage Infrastructure:</strong> Jalaun lacks effective water harvesting structures, such as ponds, check dams, and tanks, which could help in storing rainwater for use during the dry seasons.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Jalaun's groundwater levels have been declining by over 3 meters in the last decade due to overexploitation and insufficient recharge from rainfall.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="strategies">
        <h2>Water Management Strategies</h2>
        <p>Several water management strategies have been implemented in rural Jalaun to mitigate water scarcity. These include:</p>

        <h3>1. Rainwater Harvesting</h3>
        <p>Rainwater harvesting systems have been set up in several villages to capture and store rainwater for both agricultural and domestic purposes. Key initiatives include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Constructing and rehabilitating traditional water storage structures such as ponds and tanks.</li>
            <li>Building check dams and contour trenches to slow down surface runoff and allow groundwater recharge.</li>
            <li>Introducing rooftop rainwater harvesting systems in households to collect rainwater for drinking and domestic use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Watershed Management</h3>
        <p>Watershed management programs have been introduced to promote the conservation of water, soil, and vegetation in the region. This includes afforestation and soil conservation measures aimed at enhancing water retention in the soil and reducing erosion.</p>

        <h3>3. Promotion of Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation</h3>
        <p>To promote water-efficient farming practices, drip and sprinkler irrigation systems have been introduced in Jalaun. These methods minimize water wastage by delivering water directly to the plant roots.</p>

        <h3>4. Government and NGO Initiatives</h3>
        <p>The government and various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have played a critical role in addressing water scarcity in Jalaun. Several programs have been introduced, including the <strong>Bundelkhand Package</strong> and <strong>Jal Shakti Abhiyan</strong>, which focus on providing infrastructure for water harvesting, irrigation, and groundwater recharge.</p>

        <h3>5. Community Participation</h3>
        <p>Involving the local community in water management efforts has been a key strategy in Jalaun. Water user associations and village-level committees have been formed to monitor water usage, maintain water harvesting structures, and promote awareness about water conservation techniques.</p>
