            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Chitrakoot, located in the Bundelkhand region of India, has historically faced water scarcity due to erratic rainfall and limited water resources. However, through various water management initiatives, the region has seen improvements in water availability, which has benefitted agriculture, local livelihoods, and the environment. This page explores the efforts and strategies implemented to tackle water scarcity in Chitrakoot.</p>

        <section id="strategies">
            <h2>Water Management Strategies in Chitrakoot</h2>
            <p>Several key water management strategies have been implemented in Chitrakoot to improve water availability and ensure sustainable water use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rainwater Harvesting:</strong> Rainwater harvesting systems have been set up to capture and store rainwater for use during dry periods. This helps reduce reliance on groundwater and ensures a steady supply of water for both domestic and agricultural needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Check Dams and Reservoirs:</strong> Small check dams and reservoirs have been constructed to collect and store runoff water, which can then be used for irrigation and recharging groundwater levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Watershed Development:</strong> Watershed development programs focus on restoring and managing the local watershed, improving soil moisture, and increasing groundwater recharge through contour bunding, trenching, and afforestation.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Involvement:</strong> Local communities are actively involved in managing water resources through initiatives such as Jal Sanchay (water conservation), where they work together to implement and maintain water conservation structures.</li>
            </ul>
