            </figure>
            <p>Desalination is a critical technology for addressing water scarcity by converting seawater into fresh water. This process is essential in regions where freshwater resources are limited but seawater is abundant.</p>
            <h3>Techniques</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Reverse Osmosis</dt>
                <dd>Reverse Osmosis (RO) involves forcing seawater through a semi-permeable membrane that removes dissolved salts and impurities. This method is widely used due to its efficiency and effectiveness.</dd>
                
                <dt>Multi-Stage Flash Distillation</dt>
                <dd>Multi-Stage Flash (MSF) distillation heats seawater to create vapor and then condenses it to obtain fresh water. This method is energy-intensive but is used in large-scale desalination plants.</dd>
                
                <dt>Electrodialysis</dt>
                <dd>Electrodialysis uses an electric field to drive ions through selective ion-exchange membranes, separating salt from the water. This technique is suitable for brackish water and has lower energy consumption compared to MSF.</dd>

        <!-- Water Recycling Section -->
        <section id="recycling">
            <h2>Water Recycling</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="recycling.jpg" alt="Water Recycling Facility">
                <figcaption>A water recycling facility treating wastewater.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Water recycling involves the treatment of wastewater to make it suitable for reuse. This technology reduces the demand for fresh water and helps manage wastewater more efficiently.</p>
            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Gray Water Recycling</dt>
                <dd>Gray water recycling involves the collection and treatment of water from sinks, showers, and washing machines. This water is then used for non-potable purposes such as irrigation and toilet flushing.</dd>
                
                <dt>Black Water Treatment</dt>
                <dd>Black water, which comes from toilets and industrial processes, requires advanced treatment to remove pathogens and contaminants. Techniques include activated sludge processes and membrane bioreactors.</dd>
                
                <dt>Rainwater Harvesting</dt>
                <dd>Rainwater harvesting involves collecting and storing rainwater from rooftops and other surfaces for later use. This method can be integrated with existing water systems to reduce reliance on potable water sources.</dd>
            </dl>

        <!-- Smart Irrigation Section -->
        <section id="irrigation">
            <h2>Smart Irrigation</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="irrigation.jpg" alt="Smart Irrigation System">
                <figcaption>A smart irrigation system optimizing water usage in agriculture.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Smart irrigation systems use technology to optimize the amount of water used for agricultural purposes. These systems help conserve water and improve crop yields by applying the right amount of water at the right time.</p>
            <h3>Technologies</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Drip Irrigation</dt>
                <dd>Drip irrigation delivers water directly to the root zone of plants through a network of tubing and emitters. This method minimizes water waste through evaporation and runoff.</dd>
                
                <dt>Sprinkler Systems</dt>
                <dd>Modern sprinkler systems can be equipped with sensors and timers to adjust watering schedules based on weather conditions and soil moisture levels.</dd>
                
                <dt>Weather-Based Controllers</dt>
                <dd>Weather-based controllers use real-time weather data to adjust irrigation schedules. These controllers help prevent overwatering and ensure that crops receive the optimal amount of water.</dd>
