        <h2>What is Water Scarcity?</h2>
        <p>Water scarcity refers to the situation where the demand for water exceeds the available supply in a given region. It affects both the quantity and quality of water available for human use. As the global population continues to grow, pressure on freshwater resources intensifies, exacerbating water scarcity.</p>
        <p>According to the <a href="https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/scarcity">UN Water</a>, nearly 2.3 billion people live in water-stressed countries, including those who experience severe water scarcity.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="types">
        <h2>Types of Water Scarcity</h2>
        <p>Water scarcity can be categorized into two main types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical Water Scarcity:</strong> Occurs when water resources are insufficient to meet the needs of a region. This is often found in arid regions with low annual rainfall.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Water Scarcity:</strong> Happens when water is available, but the region lacks the necessary infrastructure to access and distribute it. It is more common in developing countries.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>It is estimated that by 2025, half of the world's population will be living in water-stressed areas.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="causes">
        <h2>Main Causes of Water Scarcity</h2>
        <p>The causes of water scarcity are complex and often interconnected. Below are some of the primary drivers:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Changing weather patterns, melting glaciers, and reduced rainfall in certain areas contribute to long-term droughts.</li>
            <li><strong>Population Growth:</strong> The increasing global population results in a higher demand for water for drinking, agriculture, and industrial purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> Contamination of freshwater sources by chemicals, waste, and other pollutants reduces the availability of clean water.</li>
            <li><strong>Over-extraction:</strong> Excessive withdrawal of water from rivers, lakes, and aquifers for agriculture and industrial use depletes available resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Poor Water Management:</strong> Inefficient irrigation, leakage in supply systems, and lack of regulation lead to unnecessary water wastage.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Impacts of Water Scarcity</h2>
        <p>Water scarcity affects various sectors and has significant consequences:</p>

    <section id="solutions">
        <h2>Solutions to Water Scarcity</h2>
        <p>Tackling water scarcity requires a combination of sustainable management, innovation, and global cooperation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improving Water Efficiency:</strong> Using water-saving technologies in agriculture, such as drip irrigation, reduces wastage.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Recycling and Reuse:</strong> Treating wastewater for reuse in irrigation and industrial processes helps reduce overall demand.</li>
            <li><strong>Rainwater Harvesting:</strong> Collecting and storing rainwater can help supplement water supply, especially in regions with seasonal rainfall.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure Investment:</strong> Building and upgrading water distribution systems in economically water-scarce regions can improve access.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Awareness:</strong> Educating people about water conservation and responsible usage is key to reducing unnecessary water consumption.</li>
            <li><strong>Global Cooperation:</strong> International policies and agreements that promote water conservation and equitable distribution are crucial.</li>
