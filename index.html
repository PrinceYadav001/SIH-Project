                    Watershed </h2>
                <p>The Ipswich River Watershed, located in
                    Northeastern Massachusetts, refers to the
                    155-square-mile-area that drains into the
                    Ipswich River. This watershed is the
                    source of drinking water for approxi
                    mately 330,000 people and businesses.
                    Over the years, a variety of human activi
                    ties, including pumping of water from the
                    river and its shallow groundwater re
                    serves, has contributed to extremely low
                    flows in the river and, during some sum
                    mers, sections of the river have com
                    pletely dried up. These problems were so
                    severe that, in 2003, American Rivers, a
                    national river conservation group, desig
                    nated the Ipswich as the third most en
                    dangered river in the nation.
                    In 2004, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), under a cooperative
                    agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, implemented five water conservation pro
                    jects in the Ipswich River watershed and collaborated with researchers at Tufts University to
                    evaluate
                    their effectiveness at reducing water demand:
                    Installation of rainwater harvesting systems that collect rain running off rooftops and store it to
                    use
                    for irrigation or other outdoor purposes
                    Installation of weather-based irrigation controller switches (WICs), which track and use weather in
                    formation to ensure that automatic sprinkler systems only deliver water when it is needed
                    Incorporation of mineral amendments into the soil at a municipal athletic field to improve soil mois
                    ture retention and reduce water demand
                    Free indoor water-use audits and water-saving retrofit kits
                    Rebates for the replacement of conventional toilets and washing machines with water-efficient al
                    ternatives.
                    The irrigation controllers and soil amendment
                    projects were designed to reduce the amount of
                    water needed for lawn and landscape irrigation,
                    while the rainwater harvesting systems were de
                    signed to replace a portion of the drinking water
                    used for outdoor irrigation with rainwater. The
                    homeowner rebate and water audit programs
                    were focused on reducing indoor water consump
